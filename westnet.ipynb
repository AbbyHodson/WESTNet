The following script reads in a water linkage dataset with a user-specified year scenario and creates a network where each node represents a water utility and each edge represents the flow of water between a source and target utility. Each node in the network is then \"balanced\" by calculating a volume-weighted average of electricity consumption associated with the treatment and transmission of water. Users can create subgraphs of all the upstream or downstream nodes of a certain facility and visualize the output using a linear graph, network graph, or sankey diagram.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"6IbJxioYF59D"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":210,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"r_EIkf2gGt-5","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1710278813628,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":3513,"user":{"displayName":"Abigayle Hodson","userId":"02880304820331263887"}},"outputId":"38b71918-5ab9-4c8f-aa28-8d6b1b5f78f5"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Mounted at /content/gdrive/\n"]}],"source":["#mount Google Drive- establishes connection between script and Google Drive\n","from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/gdrive/', force_remount=True)\n","\n","#import packages\n","%matplotlib inline\n","import matplotlib as mpl\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","import matplotlib.cm as cm\n","import seaborn as sns\n","import pandas as pd\n","import numpy as np\n","import networkx as nx\n","from networkx.drawing.nx_pydot import write_dot\n","import plotly.graph_objects as go\n","import os, getpass, math, json\n","\n","#specify the path of where code is stored on your machine\n","root = '/content/gdrive/MyDrive/WESTNet/'"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Define WESTNet object class"],"metadata":{"id":"HFBctoUbGoek"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["class WESTNet(object):\n","    \"\"\"WESTNet: network model and decision-support tool for analyzing\n","    the resource consumption, energy usage, and environmental\n","    impacts of California's water supply network.\n","    \"\"\"\n","    def __init__(self, file_name, run_name = None):\n","        #check that file name has correct path and extension\n","        assert file_name[-4:] == '.csv'\n","        assert file_name[:len(root)+5] == root + 'data/'\n","        #initialize WESTNET object and read in csv data\n","        self.file = file_name\n","        self.name = file_name[60:-4];\n","        self.data = pd.read_csv(file_name)\n","        self.built = False\n","\n","    def run(self, year, labels, dot=True):\n","        \"\"\"Runs entire network assessment - builds the network using\n","        the input datafile and then \"balances\" the graph.\n","\n","        Args:\n","            year: An integer specifying the scenario year.\n","            labels: A boolean indicating if volume and energy values\n","                associated with link should be recorded in resulting\n","                network and dot file.\n","            dot: A boolean indicating if a dotfile of the entire\n","                network should be saved\n","\n","        Returns:\n","            Nothing.
